Basic website for COMP 490 to show use of CGI

To access the page on my csun site go to
# www.csun.edu/~mj47069/cgi-bin/simple.cgi
you can also add ~mj47069/cgi-bin/simple.cgi?{query} at the end to see what page you get with that request.

all files are in cgi-bin
------
simple.cgi -- cgi script
baseindex.html -- landing page
queryindex.html -- when you make a query
404.html -- when you make a request with any verb other than 'GET'
490.css -- styling
